                            <p>üëã Hello! I'm a self-taught full-stack developer with a passion for continuous learning and self-improvement. My journey into programming began in 8th grade when my math teacher introduced me to robotics. Since then, I've been hooked on creating and building projects as a hobby.</p>
                            <p>üíª I primarily work with Python, but I also have some knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, PHP, CSS, Docker, and Git, with a bit of experience in Java. One of my notable projects is LockNest, a personal version of a password manager inspired by my dissatisfaction with Dashlane's updates. Additionally, I've developed several Discord bots, evolving from the old "!" commands to the more modern "/" commands.</p>
                            <p>üõ†Ô∏è Despite not having certifications yet, I've taken various tech-related classes, including robotics and programming. Outside of coding, I enjoy cooking üç≥ and am a gaming enthusiast üéÆ, particularly fond of playing old-school games through emulators.</p>
                            <p>üåü While I'm still finding my place in tech communities, I'm excited to connect, learn, and share knowledge with others. Feel free to reach out and say hi! or tell me how shit my website is but thank you and have an amazing day.</p>
                            <p>Check out some of my projects:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>LockNest:</strong> A password manager for secure credential storage.</li>
                                    <li><strong>QR-Fi_Connect:</strong> Simplifies Wi-Fi sharing using QR codes.</li>
                                    <li><strong>DDB-DiscordDataBot:</strong> A Discord bot for data management and fun interactions.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
